/* We want to do the following

http://imgur.com/n1xml
 1. Get info about an image with the ID n1xml
 2. Upload an image to imgur using the public API. The image to use is http://i68.tinypic.com/23upv91.gif.
 3. Get the size of the image when that's done. 
 4. Add the image to the page, with double the height and width
 5. If time, only return the id so it feels forced
 6. If time, do #2 in a separate call
 
 getClientId() is an existing function which returns a promise which has the clientId.
