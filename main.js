 1. Get info about an image with the ID n1xml. You can hardcode in the clientId.
 2. Do the same but use getClientId.js
 3. Upload an image to imgur using the public API. The image to use is http://i68.tinypic.com/23upv91.gif.
 4. Get the size of the image when that's done. 
 5. Add the image to the page, with double the height and width
